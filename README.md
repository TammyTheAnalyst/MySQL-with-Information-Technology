## Project Overview: MySQL in Information Systems

In this project, I explored the role of MySQL in information systems by working through hands-on exercises using MySQL Workbench. I learned how to create, manage, and populate a relational database while gaining practical experience with MySQL's core features.

### Learning Objectives:
- **Understand the role of MySQL** in information systems and its importance in managing and storing data.
- **Familiarize myself with MySQL features**, including data types, indexes, and query capabilities.
- **Learn how to start and stop a MySQL database server** to ensure proper database management.
- **Create a MySQL database** and design a structured database schema.
- **Populate a database table** by adding, modifying, and retrieving data using SQL queries.

This project helped me build a solid foundation in database management using MySQL, which is a critical tool for managing data in modern applications.
